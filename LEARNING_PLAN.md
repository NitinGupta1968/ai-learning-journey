   python -m venv ai-env
   
   # Activate it (Windows)
   ai-env\Scripts\activate
   
   # Install essential packages
   pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib requests openai python-dotenv
   ```

3. **Folder Structure to Create:**
   ```
   📁 ai-learning-journey/
   ├── 📁 00-setup/
   ├── 📁 01-foundations/
   ├── 📁 02-simple-chatbots/
   ├── 📁 03-ai-agents/
   ├── 📁 04-projects/
   ├── 📁 05-resources/
   └── 📄 README.md
   ```

4. **Create your first file:**
   - In `01-foundations/`, create `hello_ai.py`
